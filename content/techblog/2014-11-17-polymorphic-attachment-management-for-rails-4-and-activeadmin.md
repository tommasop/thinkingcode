Following my [2012 post!!!][1] I finally managed to write down a small gem that allows anyone to add multiple files to any model in his rails app.

The gem has the highly innovative name of: **AttachIt**.

As the original post also took into account ActiveAdmin I managed to add the same functionalities to ActiveAdmin also.

The gem is thought for use in the show action for your model.

I have a lot of websites with this requirement of handling multiple files for multiple models so I think this must be a fairly common pattern.

I also use [activeadmin][2] quite broadly and find it highly flexible. And it is indeed! Here I use [dropzonejs.com][3]Â inside activeadmin and also import bootstrap modal and grid to handle the responsive image gallery.
