I thought that, almost in my forties, I was big enough to have my own website.  
The name thinking code is obviously linked to my job as a developer which is mainly thinking about code.

But this won&#8217;t be only a blog about ruby and rails code, I&#8217;d like to talk about different codes. There are several codes you can find in society:

  * economical
  * political
  * ethical
  * anthropological
  * theological

I like to write about all this different topics trying to unveil patterns, errors and possible refactoring.  
Sometimes looking at things from other perspectives is stimulating and can bring about new ideas and solutions.  
What about a Test Driven Development theory for economy or a Behavior Driven Development of a political system.

Actually both the economical and the political systems are out of control and is quite self evident that the last great ideology of the west is crumbling down.

There has never been a better moment to debug errors in the existing codes and think about new solutions.
