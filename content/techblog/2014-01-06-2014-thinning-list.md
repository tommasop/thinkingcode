To be faithful to my motto

> Thin code is king code

I&#8217;m willing to slim down my development/deployment stack.

This year I will:

  1. Switch from rvm to [chruby][1]
  2. Migrate this blog from WordPress to either [LocomotiveCMS][2] or [Jeckyll][3]
  3. Thin down all development and deployment by using [Docker][4]
  4. Learn [Go][5] (this is just because to thin down code you need to use the thinnest tool available for each task)

Happy coding year.

P.S. while at it I&#8217;d also like to thin myself a bit &#8230;
